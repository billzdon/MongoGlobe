module Wrest::Native
  # This class is a wrapper for a keep-alive HTTP connection. It simply passes the
  # same connection instance as an option to all Wrest::Http::Request instances created using it.
  #
  # If at any point the server closes an existing connection during a Session by returning a
  # Connection: Close header the current connection is destroyed and a fresh one created for the next
  # request.
  #
  # The Session constructor can accept either a String URI or a Wrest::Uri as a parameter. If you
  # need HTTP authentication, you should use a Wrest::Uri.
